# stream-telemetry
This project is aiming to be an Android app which lets you livestream activities like cycling,
running, etc, while also showing live overlays of sensors like heartrate, gps, cadence, power, etc.

Typically people add these things after the fact in editing, but it would be cool to not have to do
that, or to be able to stream to twitch and just have all the information present easily.
